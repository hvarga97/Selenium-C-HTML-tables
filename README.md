# Selenium-with-C-
Small project showing how to use Selenium C# to interact with HTML tables 

**Documentation**

**The video simple HTML tables** is about was about writing custom methods to work with simple HTML Tables in Selenium. I have created 3 classes. The Base.cs class was used just to define the driver. The TablePage.cs class is used to define a table. The Utilities.cs class is used to define methods ReadTable ReadCell. ReadTable method is used to read the whole table and put the elements into a created list called _tableDataCollection. ReadCell method is used to return the data from a cell. In the main program I initialised the driver and navigated it to the local HTML table, after that I just used created methods to read the table, then in two examples, I wrote in the console a few cells that the program read.  

**The video complex HTML tables** is about extending the code done by following the first video to work with checkboxes and buttons.
